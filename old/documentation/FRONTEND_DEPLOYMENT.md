   ```

## Step 3: Access Your Frontend

After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
```
https://aiboa-frontend-production.up.railway.app
```

Visit this URL to access your AIBOA platform with full UI!

## Step 4: Test the Application

### Test Transcription
1. Click "üìù Transcription" in sidebar
2. Upload a sample audio file or enter YouTube URL
3. Wait for processing
4. View and download transcript

2. View platform metrics
3. Check service health status

## Local Development (Optional)

If you want to test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /Users/jihunkong/teaching_analize/frontend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export TRANSCRIPTION_API_URL=https://teachinganalize-production.up.railway.app
export ANALYSIS_API_URL=https://amusedfriendship-production.up.railway.app
export API_KEY=test-api-key

# Run locally
streamlit run app.py
```

Visit http://localhost:8501 to see the app locally.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Service not starting
**Solution**: Check Railway logs
```bash
railway logs --service aiboa-frontend
```

### Issue: API connection errors
**Solution**: Verify environment variables in Railway dashboard

### Issue: File upload not working
**Solution**: Check file size limits (max 200MB) and formats

### Issue: Slow loading
**Solution**: Railway free tier may have cold starts. Upgrade for better performance.
