## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

### High Risk Items

#### 1. YouTube Access Still Blocked on AWS
**Probability**: Low (AWS has better IP reputation)
**Impact**: High (core feature requirement)
**Mitigation**: 
- Test YouTube access in AWS trial environment first
- Have proxy/VPN fallback options ready
- Consider YouTube Data API v3 as alternative

#### 2. Database Migration Data Loss
**Probability**: Low (with proper testing)
**Impact**: Critical (all user data)
**Mitigation**:
- Multiple backup points before migration
- Test migration scripts extensively
- Keep Railway as backup during migration
- Validate data integrity post-migration

#### 3. Service Performance Degradation
**Probability**: Medium (different infrastructure)
**Impact**: Medium (user experience)
**Mitigation**:
- Baseline performance testing pre-migration
- Container resource monitoring and optimization
- Load balancing and auto-scaling configuration

### Medium Risk Items

#### 1. DNS Migration Downtime
**Probability**: Medium (DNS propagation delays)
**Impact**: Medium (temporary accessibility)
**Mitigation**:
- Use Route 53 for faster DNS propagation
- Schedule migration during off-peak hours
- Communicate maintenance window to users

#### 2. SSL Certificate Issues
**Probability**: Low (AWS handles certificates)
**Impact**: Medium (security warnings)
**Mitigation**:
- Test SSL setup in staging environment
