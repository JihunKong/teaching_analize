# 🔧 Streamlit Railway Deployment Fix

## 🚨 Problem
Streamlit frontend on Railway was failing with 404 errors:
```
GET https://aiboa-frontend-production.up.railway.app/Transcription/_stcore/host-config 404 (Not Found)
```

## ✅ Applied Fixes

### 1. Updated `.streamlit/config.toml` (Railway-Specific)
```toml
[server]
# Railway-specific server configuration  
port = 8501
address = "0.0.0.0"
baseUrlPath = ""

# Disable problematic features for Railway
enableCORS = false
enableXsrfProtection = false
enableWebsocketCompression = false
headless = true

[browser]
# Railway domain configuration
serverAddress = "aiboa-frontend-production.up.railway.app"
serverPort = 443
gatherUsageStats = false
```

### 2. Enhanced `railway.json` Start Command
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0 --server.headless=true --server.enableCORS=false --server.enableXsrfProtection=false --server.enableWebsocketCompression=false"
  }
}
```

### 3. Renamed Page Files (Fixed Routing Issues)
- `1_📝_Transcription.py` → `1_Transcription.py`
- `2_🔍_Analysis.py` → `2_Analysis.py` 
- `3_📊_Statistics.py` → `3_Statistics.py`

**Reason**: Emojis in filenames were causing routing confusion where Streamlit interpreted `/Transcription/_stcore/host-config` instead of `/_stcore/host-config`

### 4. Standardized Page Icons
Changed all page icons to 🎯 for consistency and Railway compatibility.

## 🎯 Technical Root Causes Fixed

1. **CORS/XSRF Conflicts**: Railway's proxy was interfering with Streamlit's security features
2. **WebSocket Issues**: Railway had problems with compressed WebSocket connections  
3. **Routing Confusion**: Special characters in page filenames caused URL path issues
4. **Server Configuration**: Missing Railway-specific server address and port settings

## 📋 Deployment Process

1. All configuration changes applied ✅
2. Files renamed to remove special characters ✅
3. Ready for commit and deployment ✅

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Commit changes to Git
2. Push to GitHub (triggers Railway auto-deploy)
3. Monitor Railway deployment logs
4. Test all endpoints after deployment
5. Verify WebSocket connections work

## 🚀 Expected Results

- ✅ No more 404 errors on `/_stcore/host-config`
- ✅ Proper WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- ✅ All pages load without routing issues
- ✅ File uploads and API calls work correctly
- ✅ Multi-page navigation functions properly

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
- Check Railway deployment logs via dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Consider testing with a simple single-page app first
- Alternative: Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud for comparison
