# AIBOA Project Analysis & AWS Lightsail Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

AIBOA (AI-Based Observation and Analysis) is a **successful classroom teaching analysis platform** that has been fully implemented with working microservices on Railway. The project demonstrates strong product-market fit for Korean educational environments with one critical technical blocker: YouTube access restrictions due to Railway's IP blocking.

**Current Status**: 95% Complete - All core functionality implemented and deployed
**Critical Issue**: YouTube caption extraction blocked by Railway IP restrictions
**Solution**: Migration to AWS Lightsail for better IP reputation and YouTube access
